2024-10-06 : Sisyphus news delivery system

	Author : Ghiunhan Mamut <venerix@redcorelinux.org>

Bug https://bugs.redcorelinux.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163 has shown that
not everyone of you are reading the news we post on the website and
as a result, you may miss important news such as the profile change
described in the above bug report.

We took the bug-report very seriously, as such changes can completely
break the system if not acted upon in a timely manner. As such, we've
been working on a news delivery system, similar to what Portage has.

Important news will be delivered straight to your terminal every time
you run the 'sisyphus update' command starting with Sisyphus v6.2410.0. 
You can then list the articles using the 'sisyphus news list' command, 
mark them as read using the 'sisyphus news read <INDEX>' command, or 
mark them as unread using the 'sisyphus news unread <INDEX>' command.

For detailed information about the usage, use the 'sisyphus news --help'
command.
