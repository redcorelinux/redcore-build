2024-10-06 : Sisyphus news delivery system

	Author : Ghiunhan Mamut <venerix@redcorelinux.org>

Bug   https://bugs.redcorelinux.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163  has   shown  that   not
everyone of you are reading the news we post on the website and as a result, you
may miss important  news such as the  profile change described in  the above bug
report.

We took the bug-report very seriously,  as such changes can completely break the
system if not  acted upon in a timely  manner. As such, we've been  working on a
news delivery system, similar to what Portage has.

Important news  will be delivered straight  to your terminal every  time you run
the 'sisyphus  update' command  starting with Sisyphus  v6.2410.0. You  can then
list the  articles using  the 'sisyphus  news list' command,  mark them  as read
using the 'sisyphus news read <INDEX>' command, or mark them as unread using the
'sisyphus news unread <INDEX>' command.

For  detailed  information about  the  usage,  use  the 'sisyphus  news  --help'
command.

2024-10-09 : Clang/LLVM toolchain update

	Author : Ghiunhan Mamut <venerix@redcorelinux.org>

The  system's default  LLVM_SLOT has  been updated  from version  '17' to  '18',
reflecting the upgrade of the entire Clang/LLVM toolchain to version 18.1.8 from
17.1.6.

The   upgrade   process  is   generally   seamless,   except  in   cases   where
media-gfx/blender SLOT 4.0, version 4.0.2-r1, is installed on the system. Due to
its incompatibility with the new Clang/LLVM toolchain, we have made the decision
to remove it from the repository.

Therefore, if you have media-gfx/blender  SLOT 4.0, version 4.0.2-r1, installed,
it  must be  removed  to proceed  with  the upgrade  and  prevent any  potential
conflicts.

To remove it, run the following command:

	sisyphus uninstall media-gfx/blender:4.0

This should be  done prior to attempting  the system upgrade to  ensure a smooth
process.

If media-gfx/blender SLOT 4.0, version 4.0.2-r1 is not installed  on your system,
you can disregard the above instructions.
